# PROJETO URANIA

## O que é o projeto Urania

### URÂNIA
----
Urania was, in Greek mythology, the muse of Astronomy, mathematics, memorys,
surrealism and Astrology. Inspired by the legend of this Muse and the stunning images
of the Hubble telescope provided for this challenge, we seek to bring young people
and children closer to the history of international space exploration, as well as to help
those who want to find a way of life in science to realize that contact with science is
magical, grandiose, charming and above all, possible, including for minorities
historically excluded from academic and scientific societies.  
Through brief works and interactive mini-games that tell the story of American space
exploration, the aim is to make the young audience believe in their own talent and
dedication and understand that history is only done when you do not give up on the
first difficulties.  
In addition, the historical detail contained in the game research process, coupled with
the Hubble telescope images present throughout the game, do the job of showing
alternative realities and awakening creativity, which is a way to include socially and
awaken for new alternatives of life, as scientific dissemination, anywhere in the world,
changes the future of education and science across the globe.

### APRESENTAÇÃO
---
Urania is an educational point-and-click game where the main goal is to revive high
relevance missions in NASA's space exploration history.  
The main historical point portrayed in the Demo version is the Mercury Project - 1958
to 1963, which was NASA's first manned space exploration project. It aimed at the
long and medium term to prepare the technology that would take man to the moon.  
Another important point that appears in this project is the famous Kennedy speech
that challenged America to land on the Moon before the late 1970s changed the initial
plans of the Mercury project.  
Successful in testing the conditions of astronauts and equipment, this project prepared
the technology that would be used in the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft.
